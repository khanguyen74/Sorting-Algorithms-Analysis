### Sorting Algorithms Analysis

This Java program runs multiple sorting algorithms (Inserting Sort, Selection Sort, Quick sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort and Radix Sort) and display performance factors including their running time, number of comparisons, number of swaps. It also displays which algorithm gives best running time. This project gives some fundamental ideas of the differences between sorting algorithms. You can choose to create a list up to 100,000 elements and you can choose to create the list that is sorted in ascending order, descending order or completely random.
